#IPK project 1

### Implementation
Project implements simple **HTTP server**, that translates domain names to IPv4 adresses and vice versa.
Server can process one **POST** and one **GET** request. If format of requests is not as described below
server returns **400 Bad Request**.
 ___

#### Get Request
Format: 
* `GET /resolve?name=<domain_name>&type=A`
    * result is translated domain_name to IPv4 address 
* `GET /resolve?name=<IPv4_addr>&type=PTR`
    * result is translated IPv4 address to domain_name

If server can't find any result, it ends with status code 404 Not Found.

#### Post Request
Format:
* `POST /dns-query`

Body has following format:
* **REQUEST:TYPE** where *REQUEST* is domain name or IPv4 address and *TYPE* is A or PTR
* one request per line

#### Other types of requests
Server returns *405 Method Not Allowed*

 ___

#### Usage
        
In root directory of project run:
 
`make run PORT=<port_number>`
 
 where port_number is in range <1024,65353>

To delete files generated by compiling run `make clean`
